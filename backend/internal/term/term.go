// Package term talks to the terminal emulator through the terminal itself.
//
// Focus uses iTerm2's proprietary "StealFocus" escape (OSC 1337): written to
// a tab's tty, iTerm brings that window forward — including a hidden hotkey
// window — with the tab selected. No AppleScript, no macOS permissions.
//
// Windows has no ttys to write to, so both calls report that focus isn't
// available there (see term_windows.go).
